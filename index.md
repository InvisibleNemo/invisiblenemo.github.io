# Beginner's Projects on Machine Learning and Data Science
## This website hosts various projects on machine learning which with small fully functional codes. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/InvisibleNemo/invisiblenemo.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Requirements to run projects codes

1. Jupyter Notebook - I would recommend using Anaconda with Python3. https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. Create project folders.
3. You should not need any extra packages to run these codes.
